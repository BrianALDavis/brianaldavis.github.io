           <p> I am a determined MSc Student and BSc Computer Science Graduate, currently working within Sheffield Hallam
             University as a Part-Time Student Researcher. I spend my time advancing my skills wherever possible.
             I am someone who is always looking for the next project to work on, and can be considered to be something of a workaholic.
             I have completed a variety of projects throughout my time in Education and have also undertaken fantastic opportunities to work with
             some of the most well known professionals in the field of Data Science. I am currently working towards my Masters in Big Data Analytics at Sheffield Hallam University.

   	         <p>I am a more mature student, who once decided to go into the world of work after college rather than attend University.
               My return to Education has seen me achieve things I didn't think possible, which includes my Bachelors Degree with a
               1st Class in Computer Science. My experiences have been amazing, and my path towards a career
               in Data Science has made tremendous strides in the last 5 years.
               As part of the 2020 cohort, I decided to continue my Education, onto a Masters in the field of Analytics, where I am currently.

                     As someone with no programming background prior, I worked on the languages of C#, Python, SQL, Data Mining and Linux Based Systems.

            <p> During my final year at the University of Hull, I worked on my Honours Dissertation on the topic of Sentiment Analysis.
              With the combined use of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings, training and classification of tweets is successfully implemented with good results. Variations in trainable data demonstrated that removal of stopwords, can have a negative effect on classification accuracy.
              Indexing and Tokenization are used effectively to feed data into Neural Networks. Results are evaluated based on data trained alongside different type of hidden layers across Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

            <p>For my Masters Degree, I was tasked with developing a smart recommendation system that takes a Music Library and gives the user the ability to search for songs by word, artists by name and compare songs / artists by numerical IDs.
              Using the Metrics of Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity and Jaccard Similarity, the user is given the option to choose a suitable Metric and compare either two songs or two artists.
              This project will be improved upon through Dec 2020 to Jan 2021 where a Machine Learning aspect will be added.

              Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the task here was to explore, define and work with Data to determine if it is possible to predict if a patient
              will be at risk or not based on the Data we have. This was done by creating a variety of Models in Data Science such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours and Nueral Networks, tuning the hyper-parameters of these to suite the purpose.
